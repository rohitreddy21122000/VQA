# VQA
visual question and answering systems in telugu is multimodel neural net based architecture where we have an vision model and NLp model working together 
to solve the the problem statement given below 

Problem Statement : given an Image as an input and a query pertaining to the Image in Telugu it should come up with correct answer to that question
Step 1: create image embeddings
Step 2: create embeddings for the Q&A and use a deep learning model to normalize the dimensions of various embeddings with different dimensions
step 3 see that image embedding and Q&A embeddings are of same dimensions and perform Element wise Multiplication
Step 4 Now train the model
